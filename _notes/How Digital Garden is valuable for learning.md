As a junior developer, building in public and share your learning path is probably the best things you can do. But sometimes, you could be a bit scared about feedback on twitter for example, digital garden is here for you.

Accumulate personal knowledge over time in an explorable space, present information in a richly linked landscape that grows slowly over time.

It's less about interactive learning, more about public learning. 
As a beginer developer it's the best thing you can do to find your first job.
