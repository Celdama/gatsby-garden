Notes

Fleeting notes:

- reminders of what you have on your head, only reminders and can be written in any kind of way and will have to end up in the trash within a day or two.

Literature notes:

- read something, make notes about the content.
- Keep it very short, be extremely selective, and use your own words.
- Understand first and write them in your own words.
- bibliographical details.
- are short and meant to help with writing slip-box notes

Permanent notes:

- Think about how they (literature notes) relate to what is relevant for your research.
- The idea is not to collect but to develop ideas, arguments, and discussions
- Use full sentences, make references and be as precise, clear, and brief as possibl
- They will never be thrown away and contain the necessary information in themselves in a permanently understandable way.
- add actual value to your system
- Use full sentences and be clear and as brief as possible
- They are atomic in nature i.e. one note can only have 1 idea
- Make references
- Link with related notes
