- gardening is about claiming a small patch of the web for yours, one you fully own and control
- should not live on the servers of Facebook, Twitter etc..
	- none of these are designed to help you slowly build and weave personal knowledge
	- most of them actively fight against it
	- if any of those services go under, your writing and creations sink with it
- owning your gardens helps you plan for long-term change
	- you should think about how you want your space grow over the next few decades
	- just imagine your garden in 10years of learning web development
- you can build your garden in HTML/CSS, that makes it easy to transfer and adapt your garden.
	- is a safe bet and beginner friendly
	- backing up your notes as flat markdown files
- gardens are independant but we can make link between several gardens
