- pass along your knowledge to the rest of the world
- provide a problem and solution in a unique and clear fashion

Structure

- first section should be describe the problem/topic
  - and proposed solution
  - why you're writing this tutorial, but don't get into a meandering narrative about your life
  - if tuto is long, good place to lay out a roadmap of table of content
- second section
  - the reason you've created the tutorial

Audience

- before type a word, first decide on your audience
  - developers familiar w/ the topic?
  - new to the topic?
  - experienced JS dev?
  - figure this out and stick w/ it for the entire article.

Show before tell

- before getting into the tutorial, show the end product

- make sur the code works

Start small

- use simple exemple first
- your reader, presumably, has never worked w/ what you're explaining

Write beyond the documentation

- don't just copy the docs
- as tutorial writter, it's your job to expand on, not regurgitate
- read the doc for yourself, will make the tutorial much better

Keep the code blocks to a minimum

- no one wants to read 75 line code block

Write what you want

- write from your experience
- following your gut will make your tuto feel more authentic and knowledgeable

Some don'ts

- do not use the dreaded foo, bar and bazz
  - lose all meaning
- use words with real meaning

Your ego

- you're here to teach
- we're smart but we don't know EVERYTHING
  - in many articles, the author spends more time trying to sound smart
- check our egos at the door
  - and focus our egos at the door and focus on helping our readers understand code instead of putting our knowledge on display

Fear

- don't be afraid to create a tutorial
- it's easy to get imposter syndrome
  - get intimidated because it seems like everyone writes more elegant code than you
  - which can make some people hesitant to try and pass their knowledge along to others
- view our articles for helping people, as service, instead of worrying about how other developers will judge us
- if you help ONE person learn something new or solve a coding proble, you've succeeded
