- importance of learning in public
	- I was hire thanks to my twitter

- twitter
	- lack of confidence in twitter 
		- especially as beginner
	- all your tweet as mostly forgetten 
		- sometimes I really want to see my oldest tweet, but it's so hard
	- everything is formatted
	- you've just 140 char to express yourself
	- so need to find a place, like your own parcel on internet
		- it's yours
- for find your first job as beginner/self-taught
	- which will make you an employable person is what you'll have learned
		- and this project is the best place to show what you've learned
	- if I was a recruiter, I would love to have this kind of place to learn about a candidate
- just imagine in 10 years, how your place could be, just imagine. 
- familiarize w/ dev tools
	- github (push, create repo, etc)
	- netlify 
	- markdown
	- jekyll

- more personal goeal
