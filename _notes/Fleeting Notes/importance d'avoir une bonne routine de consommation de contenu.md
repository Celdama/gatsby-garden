- en tant que dev, il y aura toujours une partie de ton taff où tu auras besoin d'apprendre/rechercher par toi même
- tout le monde (Beginner/JR/SR) à un moment le besoin d'apprendre quelque chose qu'ils n'ont pas connu


Pourquoi tu voudrais apprendres quelque chose de nouveau? 
- job requirement
- a new framework is becoming the more popular option
- new tech is gaining traction
- market shift
- new tech has solved a problem and has become a defacto solution
- tech has become current 'meta'
- you want to expand into a new field
- sometimes you just want to learn something new because you are bored, and want something new
- you want to challenge yourself
- you need to refactor an existing service
- you want to change carrers


Comment je dois apprendre? 
- there are inefficient ways to learn
- there are efficient ways to learn
- you can waste your time by doing thing that are not going to help you
- it is important to structure your learning in a way that you gain the most from it
- you want to maximize your time to absord and master as much as you can
- you want to absolutely avoid [[Tutorial Hell]]
- a good engineer is able to identify a shitty resource, versus a beneficial one
- you don't want to spend 10 hours learning something that can take 4 hours to learn


Tu dois:
- be cautious on bad material
- scope out the good material that will be beneficial to you
- set a strong initial goal
- be smarth with your time, dont only watch long courses
- have confidence in what you build and how you build it

Path for learning:
- first start out w/ a strong defined goal
- ask fellow people in your network about the subject you want to learn
	- called the information gathering phase/prep phase
- now, it's time for the "In the trenches" phase
	- this is where you start to gather courses/blogs/videos on how to code/use the things you want to learn about
- first - I dedicate an entire google chrome window for just learning
- then I find the documentation - first tabs
- now this is a wild phase:	
	- I literally try to find as much material is I can using:
		- Youtube
		- Medium/blogs
		- Google
		- Maybe a streamer
	- as I find and open as many as I possible can and just keep them open
	- sometimes I could have as many as 20+ tabs open of material
	- I then PURGE all those tabs to have <10 (with docs)
	- you are just scanning these tabs to see if you want to invest time into it
	- I purge by:
		- date posted (outdate or not > 2/3years )
		- total view count
		- if I know the instructor
		- reviews/comments etc
- at this point, I should have my remaining tabs/ with material that I want
- I start from left to right, always starting with the docs and their walkthroughs/tutorials first
- then I make my way into crash courses, or replicating apps
- I go through all the material


I start building what I want to build which ties back to my strongly defined goal
