- digital garden = metaphore for thinking about writing and creating that focuses less on the resulting 'showpiece' and more on the process, care, and craft it takes to get there
- place where things grow
- can be very personal
- we gather and work together in community gardens to share the labor as well as the rewards of collective effort
- we're all constantly bombarded with information but the challenge is absorbing it and applying it to the context of our lives and careers
- organized with a touch of chaos around the edge
- it's relaxing to sit down to the keyboard and do a little gardening ❤️
