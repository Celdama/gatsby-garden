Learning is so much important, this is the golden era for people who value learning, are willing to invest in themselves and who are disciplined enough to take action on their own.


Staying adaptable and learning new skills gives you the best chance of staying ahead.

What is learning: 
- is a meta-skill, the most important
- our knowledge is cumulative and builds onpen istelf
	- the results of the learning are exponential
- true purpose of learning
	- to turn our knowledge into effective action (doesn't matter to learn not an important thing)
- things that don't make sense are the best learning opportunities
	- learning is more efficient when its har
	- the more you lean, the more you can remember
	- previously learned knowledge acts as a framework for new learning
	- you can google things, but you can't outsource your memory
- you don't have to learn everything (programming)
	- forgetting is essential for learning
- all learnings is simply the ability to produce results
- few people realize that learning how to learn is its own distinct skill set
- as a developer if you don't like to learn, I think you're in the wrong place




Why learning:
- being a perpetual learner is the most important skill
	- benefit of learning are exponential
- you have to know how to learn anything you want (internet life)
- you have to be a fast learner, because most of things you know today will be obsolete four years later
- you've to adopt a mindeset of a perpetual learner
- learning is your only edge, stop learning and you lose your edge
- learning is the best investment of our time
	- find the time for learning even if you're really busy and overwhelmed (7h/w)
- new tech are being developed very quickly
	- there is a deficit of people with needed skills
	- that create the potential for high compensation


How to learn: 
- pre-requisite:
	- you need to know why
	- research the subject and see what comes over and over again
- the biggest obstacle to learning is assuming you already know
- you need to remember what you are learning (not true for everything!!!)
- you need to know why you're learning something. Takes notes and have fun.
- internalize what you've learned
- working memory
	- 3/5 things
	- you can't process much information
	- goal is not to remember some random one thing but to remember thousand things which taken together helps to solve problems
- long-term memory capacity is vast
- true learning requires:
	- comtemplation
	- execution
	- reflection
- write what you read in your own language
- practice spaced repetition
- note-taking


How create a learning's habit:
- spend 7h/w (one hour per day) focused on learning
	- make it core habit, like exercise
- you can listen podcast, turn driving time into learning time. (even for english learning it's a great idea)
- when you read something or get advice, learn to see past the example and focus on the lesson and apply it to your own life
	- don't focus on the exemple itself, use it as a metaphor, and apply the lesson to your situations (programming tutorials)
	- learning something from someone else is great. But it's better if you create your own principles based on what you've learned (redux, react app organization, zustand)
- the rate of learning in your job should always be high
	- don't want to be in a career where people who have been doing it for two years can be as effective as people who have been doing it for twenty
- spend 10hours in learnings and 10minutes to share it 

- (maybe create a [digital garden|https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/09/03/1007716/digital-gardens-let-you-cultivate-your-own-little-bit-of-the-internet/|||https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden] can be useful for learning)

Importance of reading
- purpose of reading is to learn
- true learning require not only reading
	- reading
	- re-reading
	- execution
	- reflection on what you've read
- you can't just read book after book and expect to learn more
- you have to carefully choose what you read
	- be slow but consistent
- practicing spaced repetition and writing the summary of the books that you have read and comprehending in your own words also helps you to learn

The retention framework = method to learn
- involves five steps
	- 1) inspired consumption
	- 2) unstructured note-taking
	- 3) consolidation
	- 4) analogize
	- 5) idea exercise
		- this structure is sequential, but its practice is often dynamic & iterative
- space repetition is the most formal, and powerful, idea exercise method
	- method in which information is consumed at increasing intervals until it's committed to long-term memory. 
		- leverage cognitive science : the way our brains work to convert short-term to long-term memory
		- help you to retain newly-consumed information
- develop a strategy for retention that is grounded in science

1. Inspired consumption
- consumption can be bucked into two types
	- forced: compelled, eiter internally or externally
	- inspired: driven entirely by your internal inspirations (enjoy the consumption process) -> better so you need a goal

2. Unstructured note-taking
- when you start consuming, you should have a note-taking system
	- what to take not of?
		- foundation-building ideas
		- novel insights
		- things that made you go 'hmmm' or 'wow'
		- connections you identified to other topics
		- questions/confusions
		- strong reactions you had to new information
	- this first pass of notes is intended to be unstructured, writing helps ideas stick.

3. Consolidation
- zoom out and review your unstructured notes
- where you re-consume content with a specific focus on building structure around your notes in these particular ares
	- notes-taking : create a bunch of dots
	- consolidation : connecting them

4. Analogize
- take your newly-learned information and place it within your broader mental maps
- make clear comparisons and connections between newly-learned and existing information (ruby vs js)

5. Idea exercise
- think of the new idea as muscle - if left on its own, it'll atrophy, you have to exercise it
- if you exercise the idea, it'll stich and grow (side project)
- use S.P (not in all case, e.g. in programming for new concepts etc, if I code everyday, this is my spaced repetition.)


Spaced Repetition
example
- first consume the new information at 8am. Then you start 'repetitions' where you recite back learnings and fill gaps:
	- repetition 1: 9am
	- repetition 2: 12pm
	- repetition 3: 6pm
	- repetition 4: 8am
