If you want to build in public, share your learning journey about web development, but you're a bit scare about feedback etc. The solution is Digital Gardens.

What it is?
- publishing personal knowledge on the web 
	- ^ new approach
		- rather than presenting a set of polished articles, in reverse chrono order
		- act more like free form, work-in-progress wikis
		- its just a collection of evolving ideas 
			- aren't strictly organised by their publication date
			- notes are linked through contextual associations
			- notes aren't refined or complete
			- notes are published as half-finished thoughts that will grow and evolve over time
			- notes are less rigid, less performative, less perfect
- creative reimaginings of blogs have quietly take nerdier corners of the internet by storm
- sites that are more collage-like and artsy
	- less predictable and formatted than Facebook and Twitter
- digital gardens explore a wide variety of topics, frequently adjusted and changd to show growth and learning
	- particularly among people w/ niche interests.
- create an internet that is
	- less about connections and feedback
	- more about quiet spaces
- let a person wade into the unknown
- designed for delight rather than commodity
- you can:
	- discuss books and movies
	- introspective journal entries
- D.G don't follow rules
	- they're not blogs
	- they're not a social-media platform
		- but often it's through linking to other D.G
	- they can grow and change, various pages on the same topic can coexist
- D.G are not meant to be the ultimate word on a topic
	- as a slower, clunkier way to explore the internet
	- they reveal in not being THE definitive source
	- but just A source 

Why create an Digital Gardens?
- it's less about interactive learning, more about public learning
- the content is not on Twitter, and it's never deleted
- everyone does their own weird thing
- the internet (twitter, facebook etc) as it stands rewards shock value and dumbing things down.
	- by engaging in digital gardening, you are constantly finding new connections, more depth and nuance
		- when you learn more, you add to it
		- it's less about shock and rage 
		- it's more connective
- in an age of doom-scrolling and zoom fatigue, digital-garden are optimistically hopeful


Brief history
- Hypertext Gardens in 1998 by Mark Bernstein, developer
	- https://www.eastgate.com/garden/Enter.html
- After Mark's essay the term Digital Gardening goes quiet for nearly a decade
- If anyone should be considered the original source of Digital Gardening, it's Caufield
	- the first to lay out this whole idea in poetic, coherent, words
		- D.G is not about specific tools (wordpress, gatsby, jekyll etc)
		- it's a different way of thinking about our online behaviour around information
		- accumulates personal knowledge over time in an explorable space
		- present information in a richly linked landscape that grows slowly over time
		- everything is arranged and connected in ways that allow you to explore
			- you get to actively choose which curiosity trail to follow, rather than defaulting to the algorithmically-filtered ephemeral stream
		- helps us move away from time-bound streams and into contextual knowledge space
		- alternative to the way we consume and produce information
		- you garden is always in growth

Digital gardens vs. blogs
- with blogs
	- you're talking to a large audience
- with digital gardens
	- you're talking to yourself
	- you focus on what you want to cultivate over time (for learning it's a good point, because that encourage you to be more selective about what you want to learn. And keep track of your learning, and learning curve


The six patterns of gardening
- https://github.com/MaggieAppleton/digital-gardeners
- https://maggieappleton.com/pattern-languages

1. Topograpy over Timelines
- organised around contextual relationships and associative links
	- concepts and themes within each note determine how it's connected to others, we don't care about date
	- date might be included, but they aren't the structural basis of how you navigate around the garden
	- posts are connected to other 
		- through related themes
		- topics
		- shared context
			- using bi directional links 
	- a garden explore can enter at any location and follow any trail they link through the content, rathen most recent feed
	- dense links are essential
		- but gardeners often layer on other ways of exploring their knowledge base
			- thematic piles https://busterbenson.com/piles/
			- nested folder https://tomcritchlow.com/wiki/
			- tags
			- filtering functionality
			- search bar https://www.christopherbiscardi.com/garden
			- visual node graph https://wiki.nikiv.dev/
			- central index https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history
		- many entry points but no prescribed pathways

2. Continuous Growth
- gardens are never finished
	- constantly growing, evolving, and changing
	- this isn't how we usually think about writing on the web
		- carefully crafted, edited, revised, and published with a timestamp
		- when it's done, it's done
		- there is no 'final version' on a garden
			- what you publish = always open to revision & expansion
			- designed to evolve alongside your thought
![A graph of time versus amount of work. Gardening involves small amounts of work over time, while classic blogging involves a lot of work all at once.](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:best,w_1000/v1621773885/maggieappleton.com/notes/garden-history/gardentime_rrsecv.png)
			- you post ideas while they're still 'seedlings' and tend them regularly until they're fully grown, respectable opinions

3. Imperfection & Learning in Public
- are imperfect by design
	- don't hide their rough edged or claim to be a permanent source of truth
	- usually putting anything imperfect and half-written on an "official website" may feel strange
	- we have all been trained to behave like tiny, performative corporations when it comes to presenting ourselves in digital space
	- it's less performative than a blog, but more intentional and thoughtful than a Twitter feed
	- perfect balance of chaos and cultivation
	- it enables you to learn in public (maybe one of the most important thing as beginner dev)
		- practice sharing what you learn as you're learning it, not a decade later once you're an 'expert'
	- this comes with great responsability
		- publishing imperfect and early ideas requires that we make the status of our notes clear to readers
			- you should include some indicator of how 'done' they are
				- seedling : very rough and early ideas
				- budding : work cleaned up and clarified
				- evergreen : work reasonably complete (though still tend these over time)
				- dates of start, and last update
				- you can also include an epistemic status on posts 
					- short statement that makes clear how you know what you know and much time you've insteded in researching it (very optional)
				- entry could come with
					- topic tags
					- start and end date
					- a stage flag: draf, in progress, finished
					- 1-10 importance tag
	- ask the reader to allow you to be wrong, offer constructive criticism

![a spectrum of knowledge management, ranging from chaos streams to the cultivated performance of publishing a book. Gardening sits in the middle.](https://res.cloudinary.com/dg3gyk0gu/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:good,w_1100/v1593765637/maggieappleton.com/notes/garden-history/digital-garden.png)

4. Playful, Personal and Experimental
- are non-homogenous by nature
	- you can plant the same seed as your neighbour, but you'll always end up with a different arrangement of plants
- digital garden should be just as unique and particular as their vegetative counterparts
- it's a personal playspace
- you organize the garden around the ideas and mediums that match your way of thinking, rather than off someones else's stantardised template
- as developer, gardens are a chance to question the established norms of a 'personal website', and make space for weirder, wilder experiments
	- a space with some animation's test
	- a space w/ some typos
	- etc 
- one goal of gardens is deep contextualisation
	- dumping millions of people together into decontextualised social space is a shit show
	- devoid of any established social norms
	- abstracted from our specific cultural identities
		- devoid of any established social norms
		- Facebook pre-selects the categories it deems important about you  
- gardens are the higher-fidelity version, complete with quirks, contradictions and complexity 


5. Intercropping & Content Diversity
- gardens are not just a collection of interlinked words
	- podcasts, videos, diagrams, illustrations, web animations, academic papers, tweets, rough sketches, and code snippes should all live and grow in the garden


6. Independent Ownership
- gardening is about claiming a small patch of the web for yours
- one you fully own and control
- should not live on the servers of Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, etc
	- none of these are designed to help you slowly build and weave personal knowledge
	- most of them actively fight against it
	- if any of those services go under, your writing and creations sink with it
	- build on reliable, interoperable systems you own & control
- owning your garden helps you plan for long-term change
	- you should think about how you want your space to grow over the next few decades
- you can build your garden in HTML/CSS
	- that makes it easy to transfer and adapt your garden
	- is a safe bet and beginner friendly
	- backing up your notes as flat markdown files
- independent but we can make link between several gardens

Benefit of gardening:
- freed from the pressure to get everything right immediately. 
	- you can test ideas, get feedback, and revise your opinions like a good internet citizen
- it's low friction
	- gardening your thoughts becomes a daily ritual that only takes a small amount of effort
	- over time, big things grow
- it gives readers an insight into your writing and thinking process (very good point for job research as a beginner)
- gardens make their imperfection known to readers
