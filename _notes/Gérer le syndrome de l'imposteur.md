title: GÃ©rer le syndrome de l'imposteur
tags: ['syndrome', 'fleeting-notes']
---

what is ?
- it is doubting your abilities and skills -> feeling like a fraud.
- in programming, it is very relevant to have this experience, or to feel like you're "not good enough".

reasons ? 
- when you cant get a task/ticket done
- when you feel like you're asking a lot of questions
- when you feel like you just cant deliver on a task/goal
- when you have a bad day
- when you begin comparing yourself
- when you're new to a topic/programming language/technology
- feeling like you just aren't at the standard that you should be for your role
- maybe more common in engineers who are self-taught
- the difficulty to accept your own skills and accomplishments.
- feeling like you are not good enough
- we lack confidence in ourselves 
- sometimes you dont realize you're way better than you think


- when you get into this negative mentality, you typically stop seeing and realising all the good things that you are doing and only focus on the bad things. Thinking you dont deserve something.

what triggers imposter syndrome : 
- after getting hired / seeing the new team and the current skill levels of your new colleagues
- too much thinking and planning
- after getting a promotion
- making progress on a task
- getting feedback
- asking for help on a problem
- seeing colleagues work/solutions
- dealing with new technology
- getting turned down after thinking you have improved


- Imposter Syndrom poison: specific acronyms, jargon 


At what point do we get over imposter syndrome ?
- never 
- sometimes the more senior you get, the more you feel this 
- its every time you get out of your comfort zone / given more responsibility / more expectations. 
- learn to manage it as oppose to sweeping under the rug
- it can be healthy, it can be powerful, as long as it doesnt take over you or diminishes your and your work.
- the main thing you need to do : 
	a. realize when its happening
	b. take a step back, and before it manifest itself look at all your achievements and accomplishments
	c. its a signal, that you feel challenged and an opportunity to grow
- no one expects you to know everything

How a healthy/balanced lifestyle helps with Imposter Syndrome:
- you MUST have a balanced lifestyle
- aim and strive to live healthy and appreciate life
- physical exercise, hydration, sleep, and just being happy will do wonders for you
- a healthy/balanced lifestyle helps with everything
- if you feel more and more pressure from imposter syndrome, go to exercise, or AT LEAST, take a break, go outside for a walk.
	- Example: 
		Youre at your desk, and your code is just NOT working. And your colleague is able to do their things very quickly. This might trigger Imposter syndrome At this point, just stand up, close/sleep your computer go outside for 15 minutes.
- quality of your work, matters exponentially more than the quantity
- the worst you want to do, is release code and have a senior completely re-write

how to deal with negativity and naysayers
- feedback != negativity
- usually, if someone disagree with you, OR proves you wrong, or suggest to try/do something different and you get offended, you have an ego problem
- ego and imposter syndrome sometimes go hand and hand
- just focus on yourself
- dont feed the trolls
- when it comes to imposter syndrome, and you are getting negativity and slander, I would suggest to evaluate your environment because its toxic

when starting a new role, how beat the imposter syndrome:
- first thing, make sure you congratulate yourself and appreciate the fact that you got hired and you got job
- so you got hired, and you start monday. What do you do ?
I would email my manager for a list of the tech the team uses.
I would be honest with myself, in terms of my skills and what the expectations are for me. 
The reason you need to be honest with yourself, is then you will be with the rest of your team.
If you don't know a technology don't lie. What you should do instead, is be honest and say ive only heard of ..., etc etc and ask questions, ask for resources ..
- do not set high expectations, and deliver low
- do not promise false dates
- work with your manager to set realistic goals for 30, 60, 90 days

Be honest, and talk with your manager and team set yourself up for success
