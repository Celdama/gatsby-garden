- are non-homogenous by nature
	- you can plant the same seed-idea as your neighbour, but you'll always end up with a different arrangement of plants
	- it's a personal playspace
- organize the garden around the ideas and mediums that match you way of thinking
- as a develope, gardens are a chance to question the established norms of a 'personal website', and make space for weirdern, wilder experiments

	- dumping millions of people together into decontextualised social space is a shit show

		- abstracted form our specific cultural identities
		- Facebook pre-selects the categories it seems important about you
