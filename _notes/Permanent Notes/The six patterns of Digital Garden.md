### 1. Topography over Timelines 
- organised around contextual relationships and associative links
- concepts and themes within each note determine how it's connected to others
	- we don't care about date
	- date migh be included but it's optional
	- they aren't the structural basis of how you navigate around the garden
- post are connected to other through
	- related themes
	- topics
	- shared context 
	- using bi directional links
- a garden explorer can enter at any location and follow any trail they link through the content, rather most recent feed
	- but gardeners often layer on other ways of exploring
		- thematic piles https://busterbenson.com/piles/
		- nested folder https://tomcritchlow.com/wiki/
		- tags
		- filtering functionality
		- search bar https://www.christopherbiscardi.com/garden
		- visual node graph https://wiki.nikiv.dev/
		- central index https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history
	- they can be many entry points, but no prescribed pathways

### 2. Continuous Growth
- gardens are never finished
- constantly growing, evolving, and changing
	- this isn't how we usually think about writing on the web
- there is no 'final version' on a garden
- what you publish is always open to revision & expansion, designed to evolve alongside your thought
- you post ideas while they're still 'seedlings' and tend them regularly until they're fully grown.

### 3. Imperfection & Learning in Public
- they're imperfect by design, don't hide their rough edged or claim to be a permanent source of truth
- usually putting anything imperfect and half-written on an 'official website' may feel strange, not in digital gardens
- we've all beel trained to behave like tiny, performative corporations when it comes to presenting ourselves in digital space
- it's less performative than a blog
	- but more intentional and thoughtful than a Twitter feed
	- perfect balance of chaos and cultivation
- it enables you to learn in public (maybe one of the important things as beginner dev)
- practice sharing what you learn as you're learning it, not a decade later once you're an 'expert'



### 4. Playful, Personal and Experimental
- are non-homogenous by nature
	- you can plant the same seed-idea as your neighbour, but you'll always end up with a different arrangement of plants
	- it's a personal playspace
- organize the garden around the ideas and mediums that match you way of thinking
- as a develope, gardens are a chance to question the established norms of a 'personal website', and make space for weirdern, wilder experiments
- one goal of gardens is deep contextualisation
	- dumping millions of people together into decontextualised social space is a shit show
		- devoid of any established social norms
		- abstracted form our specific cultural identities
		- Facebook pre-selects the categories it seems important about you


### 5. Intercropping & Content Diversity
- are not just a collection of interlinked words
- podcast, videos, diagrams, illustrations, web animations, academic papers, tweets, rough sketch, and code snippets should all live and grow in the garden


### 6. Independent Ownership
- gardening is about claiming a small patch of the web for yours, one you fully own and control
- should not live on the servers of Facebook, Twitter etc..
	- none of these are designed to help you slowly build and weave personal knowledge
	- most of them actively fight against it
	- if any of those services go under, your writing and creations sink with it
- owning your gardens helps you plan for long-term change
	- you should think about how you want your space grow over the next few decades
	- just imagine your garden in 10years of learning web development
- you can build your garden in HTML/CSS, that makes it easy to transfer and adapt your garden.
	- is a safe bet and beginner friendly
	- backing up your notes as flat markdown files
- gardens are independant but we can make link between several gardens
