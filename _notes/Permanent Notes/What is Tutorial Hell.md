TUTORIAL HELL
- every single perso who has coded/developed has been in this hell
- tutorial hell is when you are stuck watching/doing videos/courses on a topic to keep learning
- it seems like there is always more to learn, so you keep searching
- signs you are in:
	- thousand tabs open on the topic
	- you have been 'learning' the topic for weeks now
	- you are starting to look/see the same material you already did

Why people get into T.H:
- is because they don't know when they truly have learnd the topic
- they feel they are still not good enough
- they're searching for a 'better' course/tutorial
- there is always more


How avoid T.H:
- before you start learning something, you should've a goal. A strong defined goal
- having a goal != having a strong, well defined goal
- example: 
	- "I want to learn RN to be a mobile Dev"
		- this is a goal
		- this is a WEAK goal
	- "I want to move my PWA into a siloed iOS app for better mobile experience for users"
		- this is a goal
		- this is a STRONG goal
- a strong goal sets you up for success
- a weak goal sets you up for failure
- also confidence
	- confidence is super important for when you want to develop and learn
	- you can definitely do what they are teaching you
