This comes w/ great responsability. Publishing imperfect and early ideas requires that we make the status of our notes clear to readers.

You should include some indicator of how 'done' note's are:
	- seedling: very rough and early ides
	- budding: work cleaned up and clarified
	- evergreen: work reasonably complete (though still tend these over time)
	- date of start, and last update
	- entry could come with:
		- topic tags
		- start and end date
		- a stage flag: draft, in progress, finished
		- 1-10 importance tag

Ask the reader to allow you to be wrong, offer constructive criticism.
