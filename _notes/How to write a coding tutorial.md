There are plenty of benefits of writing tutorials

- forces you to build something (small & simple)
- helps out folks to learning the same thing as you
- gets your name out there in the community
- requires that you understand what you're doing/building enough to be able to explain it to somebody else (public learning)
- shows your competency, communication skills, etc. to potential employers/collaborators

One framework

- pick a tech/tool/topic you want to learn and write about
  - tech being used at work
  - a buzzword your haven't explore yet
  - a certain skill in job description
  - recently struggle through learning
- develop a basic understanding of your tutorial's subject matter
  - keep note of things you'll want to bring up in your tuto
  - bookmark useful article, other tutorial, videos, docs, etc.. to easily reference
  - google and official documentation are your friends here
  - don't going down rabbit holes
- start exeperimenting w/ some code
  - initialize a basic boilerplate project/environment
  - time to play w/ the stuff you're learning
  - no need for structure, clean code, etc.. just make stuff hapen
  - as you get more comfortable
    - start to think about how the stuff can be structured to showcase the important aspects or your subject
  - if you run into anything not obvious or worth nothing while getting started, jot it down
    - can be a helpful tip in you're tutorial
- build the tutorial's project
  - leverage your experience from the previous step
  - the most important part of the process
    - the meat of what your audience will have to learn
  - try to keep things as simple as possible
  - no right way to build a tuto project, but here are some characteristics
    - it's the simplest way to get your points/subject across
    - it's very easy to set up - no need to install crazy stuff or get lost in configuration
    - it has clean, organized code
    - it has some real-world theme for the functionality
- rebuild from scratch while writing an outline of the tuto
  - start organizing everything you've done so far into a logical, step-by-step order
    - represent the linear progression of your tutorial
  - try to rebuild the project in as structured and progressive a way as possible
  - save code snippets as you go through rebuilding the project
- turn your outline into a rough draft
  - convert the bullet-point outline of your tuto into a long-form version w/ full-sentence instructions and code snippets
  - don't worry about adding explanations of concepts or expressive writing
    - a boring, no-frills set of instructions will suffice for this step
  - when done, you should be able to follow your tutorial and build the example project
- spruce up the rough draft
  - add in any explanations, quotes, humor, flair, nuance
  - it's nice to start a tutorial with some context for the reader
    - who this tutorial is for
    - why you're writing it
    - any prerequisite knowledge
  - add any links you've found helpul
- walk through the tutorial like you're the reader
  - like doing QA for your tutorial
  - follow the tutorial as though you have no prior knowledge/experience w/ the material
  - try to uncover any areas or steps where a reader could be confused
  - revise, reorder, fix, etc..
- publish!
