Digital Gardens is publishing personal knowledge on the web. It's a new approach, wich offers much more freedom.
Rather than presenting a set of polished articles, in reverse chrono order, act more like free form, work-in-progresse wikis.

Digital Gardens is just a collection of evolving ideas. Notes aren't strictly organised by date, the goal is to link your notes through contextual associations.
Notes:

- aren't refined or complete
- are published as half-finished thoughts that will grow and evolve over time
- are less rigid, less performative, less perfect.

Digital Gardans explore a wide variety of topics, frequently adjusted and they're here to show growth and learning. Particularly among people w/ niche interests (as a programer it's a good point).

You want to create an internet that is less about connections and feedback, we don't care about followers, more about quiet spaces. Let a person in your digital gardens wade into the unknown. Designed for delight rather than commodity.

Digital Gardens don't follow rules, you can discuss books and movies, you can share you're discover about programing, it can be an introspective journal entreis. They're not blogs, they're not a social-media platform. They can be linkied to other Digital Gardens. They can grow and change, various page on the same topic can coexist.
It's not about specific tools (wordpress, gatsby, etc), it's a different way of thinking about our online behaviour around information.
Accumulate personal knowledge over time in an explorable space, present information in a richly linked landscape that grows slowly over time.

You get to actively choose which curiosity trail to follow, rather than defaulting to the algorithmically-filtered ephemeral stream. You are in a knowledge space.

Digital Garden are not meant to be the ultimate word on a topic. Is a slower, clunkier way to explore the internet. They reveal in not being the definitive source, but just a source.

You wonder why create your Digital Garden. It's less about interactive leraning, more about public learning. As a beginer developer it's the best thing you can do to find your first job.
The content is not on Twitter, it's never deleted.
The internet (Twitter, Facebook, etc) as it stands rewards shock value and dumbing things down.
By engaging in digital gardening, you are constantly finding new connections, more depth and nuance.
When you learn more, you add to it. It's less about shock and rage, it's more connective.
In an age of doom-scrolling and zoom fatigue, digital-garden are optimistically hopeful.
Your garden is always in growth.

There is some difference w/ blogs. In blogs you're talking to a large audience, in Digital Gardens, you're talking to yourself.
You focus on what you want to cultivate over time (for learning it's a good thing, beacause that encourage you to be more selective about what you want to learn. And keep track of your learning, learning curve.)
