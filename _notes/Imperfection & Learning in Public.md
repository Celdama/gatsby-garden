- they're imperfect by design, don't hide their rough edged or claim to be a permanent source of truth
- usually putting anything imperfect and half-written on an 'official website' may feel strange, not in digital gardens
- we've all beel trained to behave like tiny, performative corporations when it comes to presenting ourselves in digital space
- it's less performative than a blog
	- but more intentional and thoughtful than a Twitter feed
	- perfect balance of chaos and cultivation
- it enables you to learn in public (maybe one of the important things as beginner dev)
- practice sharing what you learn as you're learning it, not a decade later once you're an 'expert'
