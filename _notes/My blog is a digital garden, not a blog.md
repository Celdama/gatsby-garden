Digital garden is a metaphore for thinking about writing and creating that focus less on the resulting 'showpiece' and more on the process, care, and craft it takes to get there. This is a place where things grow, can be very personal.

We gather and work together in community gardens to share the labor as well as the rewards of collective effort. 

We're all constantly bombarded w/ informations but the challenge is absorbing it and applying it to the context of our lives and careers. Organized with a touch of chaos around the edge. 

It's relaxing to sit down to the keyboard and do a little gardening ❤️
