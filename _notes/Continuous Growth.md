- gardens are never finished
- constantly growing, evolving, and changing
	- this isn't how we usually think about writing on the web
- there is no 'final version' on a garden
- what you publish is always open to revision & expansion, designed to evolve alongside your thought
- you post ideas while they're still 'seedlings' and tend them regularly until they're fully grown.
